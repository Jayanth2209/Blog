# What is Brain Fingerprinting Technology?    
* It is a revolutionary technology used to detect whether a specific piece of information is present in a person's brain or not!     
* It involves measuring brain wave responses (to words, phrases, sounds or pictures) to determine the hidden information. 
* It uses MERMER (Memory and Encoding Related Multifaceted Electroencephalographic response) to detect familiarity reaction. The person wears a special headband with sensors (electrodes) that measure EEG from several locations on the scalp.    
* The "brain print" is based on P300 complex - a surge of electrical activity (MERMER) in EEG wave, when a person sees something familiar which usually occurs 300ms after the stimulus.
